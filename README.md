# Code Assessment For Rently

### Login Page
The login page is not a server-side authentication, I uses Pinia state management to mock a user.

### DaisyUI
DaisyUI is good and I hope it is just for assessment purpose because I personally prefer Tailwind UI and Headless UI compared to opinionated named CSS classes like Bootstrap.

It's fast by just copy and pasting but not suitable for customization. It breaks the original purpose of Tailwind CSS as we need to override it in order to achieve the design we want.
