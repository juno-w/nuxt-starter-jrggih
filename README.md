# Code Assessment For Rently

### DaisyUI
DaisyUI is good and I hope it is just for assessment purpose because I personally prefer Tailwind UI and Headless UI compared to opinionated named CSS classes like Bootstrap.

It's fast by just copy and pasting but not suitable for customization. It breaks the original purpose of Tailwind CSS as we need to override it in order to achieve the design we want.
